# helm-flx

This package implements intelligent helm fuzzy sorting, provided by [`flx`](https://github.com/lewang/flx).

Note that `flx`'s author @lewang did start work on his own port of `helm-flx`, but it appears to have been abandoned. (Left unfinished without modification for nine months.) If, at any time, lewang can find time to contribute again, I would be glad.

The code is currently incomplete, but is looking at a release to MELPA sometime around the end of the month: stay tuned.
