# helm-flx

This package implements intelligent helm fuzzy sorting, provided by [`flx`](https://github.com/lewang/flx).

You can install the package by either cloning it yourself, or by doing <kbd>M-x</kbd> `package-install` <kbd>RET</kbd> `helm-flx` <kbd>RET</kbd>.

After that, you can enable it by putting the following in your init file:

```emacs
;; For best results, load this before you load helm.
(helm-flx-mode +1)
```

Some History
============

Crazy stuff simmers in my [`emacs-config`](https://github.com/PythonNut/emacs-config), and every once and a while, it's worth sharing. [This was no exception](https://github.com/PythonNut/emacs-config/blob/f1df3ac16410bfa72d88855325bd6c2de56f587b/modules/config-helm.el#L33#L89). It's been patiently evolving in my config for the better part of a year, and I think it's useful enough to benefit other people.

Note that `flx`'s author @lewang did start work on his own port of `helm-flx`, but it appears to have been abandoned. (Left unfinished without modification for nine months.) If, at any time, lewang can find time to contribute again, I would be glad.

Push to MELPA is in progress!!!
